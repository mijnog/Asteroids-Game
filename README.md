# Asteroids-Game
Use python3.11 for compatibility reasons with Pygame
Installation
```sh
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3.11 main.py 
```
This will create a virtual environment called venv, activate it, install the requirements (pygame), and run the game.
